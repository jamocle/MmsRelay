# MmsRelay

**What is MmsRelay?** A web service that makes it easy to send text messages (SMS) and multimedia messages (MMS) through your applications. Think of it as a simple bridge between your software and Twilio's phone service.

**Perfect for:** E-commerce order notifications, system alerts, marketing messages, appointment reminders, and any application that needs to send text messages to phones.

## üì± What is SMS and MMS?

- **SMS** (Short Message Service): Plain text messages up to 160 characters - like "Your order #1234 has shipped!"
- **MMS** (Multimedia Messaging Service): Messages with images, videos, or longer text - like "Here's a photo of your delivered package: [image]"
- **Twilio**: A cloud service that handles the technical complexity of sending messages through phone carriers worldwide

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üöÄ **Simple HTTP API** - Send messages with a basic web request (no complex setup)
- üì± **Works Worldwide** - Supports international phone numbers in proper E.164 format
- üõ°Ô∏è **Reliable & Safe** - Automatically retries failed sends and protects against service outages
- üìä **Production Ready** - Built-in health monitoring and structured logging
- üîß **Easy to Deploy** - Works on Windows, Linux, Docker, or cloud platforms
- üìö **Well Documented** - Comprehensive guides for beginners and experts
- üß™ **Fully Tested** - Extensive test suite ensures everything works correctly

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### What You Need First

**Software Requirements:**
- **.NET 8 SDK** - [Download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (free)
- **Git** - For downloading the code
- **Text Editor** - Visual Studio, VS Code, or any editor you like

**Twilio Account (Free):**
1. Sign up at [https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
2. Get $15 in free credits (enough for hundreds of test messages)
3. Note down your Account SID, Auth Token, and phone number

### Step 1: Get the Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamocle/MmsRelay.git
cd MmsRelay
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Credentials (Safely)

**Why we do this:** Your Twilio credentials are like passwords - we store them securely so they never accidentally get shared or committed to Git.

```bash
cd src/MmsRelay

# This creates a secure, local-only storage for your credentials
dotnet user-secrets init

# Add your Twilio credentials (replace with your real ones)
dotnet user-secrets set "twilio:accountSid" "ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
dotnet user-secrets set "twilio:authToken" "your_actual_auth_token_here"  
dotnet user-secrets set "twilio:fromPhoneNumber" "+15551234567"
```

**Where to find these values:**
- Go to [Twilio Console Dashboard](https://console.twilio.com)
- Account SID and Auth Token are on the main dashboard
- Phone number is in Phone Numbers > Manage > Active numbers

### Step 3: Start the Service

```bash
# Install any missing packages and run
dotnet run
```

**You should see:**
```
info: MmsRelay.Program[0] Starting MmsRelay service...
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14] Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14] Now listening on: https://localhost:5001
```

**Test it's working:**
- Open http://localhost:5000/health/live in your browser
- Should show: `{"status":"Healthy"}`

### Step 4: Send Your First Message

**Option A: Use the Web Interface**
1. Open http://localhost:5000/swagger in your browser
2. Click on "POST /mms" 
3. Click "Try it out"
4. Enter your phone number and message
5. Click "Execute"

**Option B: Use the Command Line**
```bash
# Replace with your actual phone number
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/mms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "+15551234567", 
    "body": "Hello from MmsRelay! üéâ"
  }'
```

**Option C: Use the Console Client** (Easiest)
```bash
# Navigate to the console client
cd ../../clients/MmsRelay.Client

# Send a message (replace with your phone number)
dotnet run -- send --to "+15551234567" --body "Hello from MmsRelay console!"
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "provider": "twilio",
  "providerMessageId": "SM1234567890abcdef",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

**Check your phone** - you should receive the message within a few seconds!

### üéâ Congratulations!

You now have MmsRelay running and can send messages. Here's what happens next:

1. **Your message goes to Twilio** - They handle delivery to phone carriers
2. **Check delivery status** - Go to [Twilio Console > Monitor > Logs](https://console.twilio.com/us1/monitor/logs/sms)
3. **Learn more** - Check out our [FAQ](FAQ.md) and [Examples](EXAMPLES.md)

## üèóÔ∏è How MmsRelay Works (Simple Overview)

### The Big Picture

```
Your App ‚Üí MmsRelay ‚Üí Twilio ‚Üí Phone Carrier ‚Üí Recipient's Phone
```

1. **Your application** sends an HTTP request to MmsRelay
2. **MmsRelay** validates the request and forwards it to Twilio  
3. **Twilio** handles the complex phone network delivery
4. **Your recipient** gets the message on their phone

### What's Inside MmsRelay

```
clients/MmsRelay.Client/          # Command-line tool for sending messages
src/MmsRelay/                     # Main web service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Api/                          # Handles incoming HTTP requests  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application/                  # Business rules (validation, etc.)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/                   # Data structures for requests/responses
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Validation/               # Rules to check if phone numbers are valid
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Infrastructure/               # Connects to external services (Twilio)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Twilio/                   # Twilio-specific code
tests/MmsRelay.Tests/            # Automated tests to ensure everything works
```

### Why This Architecture?

**Clean Architecture Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Easy to test** - Each piece can be tested independently
- ‚úÖ **Easy to change** - Want to use a different SMS service? Just swap the Infrastructure layer
- ‚úÖ **Easy to understand** - Clear separation between web API, business logic, and external services
- ‚úÖ **Easy to maintain** - Changes in one area don't break others

### Built-in Reliability Features

MmsRelay automatically handles common problems:

**üîÑ Automatic Retries**
- If Twilio is temporarily unavailable, MmsRelay waits and tries again
- Uses "exponential backoff" - waits longer between each retry attempt
- Gives up after 5 attempts to avoid infinite loops

**‚ö° Circuit Breaker**
- If Twilio is completely down, MmsRelay "fails fast" instead of wasting time
- Automatically checks if Twilio is back up and resumes when possible
- Protects your application from cascading failures

**‚è±Ô∏è Timeouts**
- Requests never hang forever - they timeout after 30 seconds
- Prevents resource leaks and keeps your system responsive

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### For Beginners: Simple Windows Deployment

The easiest way to run MmsRelay in production on Windows:

```bash
# Create a single executable file with everything included
dotnet publish src/MmsRelay/MmsRelay.csproj -c Release \
  --self-contained true --runtime win-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true

# Copy to your server (creates C:\MmsRelay folder)
xcopy publish\* C:\MmsRelay\ /E /Y

# Set your production credentials
set TWILIO__ACCOUNTSID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
set TWILIO__AUTHTOKEN=your_actual_auth_token_here  
set TWILIO__FROMPHONENUMBER=+15551234567

# Run it
C:\MmsRelay\MmsRelay.exe
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Made Simple

### Required Settings (You Must Have These)

**For Development** (stored securely on your machine):
```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "twilio:accountSid" "ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
dotnet user-secrets set "twilio:authToken" "your_auth_token" 
dotnet user-secrets set "twilio:fromPhoneNumber" "+15551234567"
```

**For Production** (environment variables):
```bash
# Windows
set TWILIO__ACCOUNTSID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
set TWILIO__AUTHTOKEN=your_auth_token
set TWILIO__FROMPHONENUMBER=+15551234567

# Linux/Mac
export TWILIO__ACCOUNTSID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export TWILIO__AUTHTOKEN=your_auth_token  
export TWILIO__FROMPHONENUMBER=+15551234567
```

### Phone Number Format Rules

**‚úÖ Correct Format (E.164):**
- Must start with `+`
- Country code next (1 for US/Canada, 44 for UK, etc.)
- No spaces, dashes, or parentheses

**Examples:**
- US: `+15551234567` (not `555-123-4567`)
- UK: `+442012345678` (not `020 1234 5678`)
- Germany: `+4930123456789` (not `030-12345678`)

### Optional Settings (Nice to Have)

**Change the Port:**
```bash
# Default is 5000/5001
set URLS=http://localhost:8080  
```

**Advanced Twilio Features:**
```bash  
# Use Messaging Service instead of phone number
set TWILIO__MESSAGINGSERVICESID=MGxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Adjust retry behavior
set TWILIO__REQUESTTIMEOUTSECONDS=60
set TWILIO__RETRY__MAXRETRIES=3
```

**Logging Levels:**
```bash
# Show more detailed logs for debugging
set LOGGING__LOGLEVEL__DEFAULT=Debug

# Show only errors and warnings
set LOGGING__LOGLEVEL__DEFAULT=Warning
```

## üì° API Reference (How to Send Messages)

### Send a Text Message (SMS)
